Hi, in this project we are assigned to implement positional inverted index searching for phrase queries and free text queries.
First we need to make preprocessing and indexing our words.
I used BeautifulSoup library so yuo need to install it to your working environment.
1) "pip install bs4" will install this library.
2) "python preprocessing.py" will run indexing module and create a file named "myIndex.txt" that stores indexes.
3) "python queryprocessing.py" Then you need to run this command for query processing module.
Each time you want to enter a new query, you need to run 3rd command.
When you run this command you will see "Please enter query:" text.
You need to enter your query here.
Then it will print the result to the screen.
Free text queries migth take some time up to 20 or 30 seconds based on the input.
